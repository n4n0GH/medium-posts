While some may have good intentions, all of them fail at implementing true censorship resistance. Let’s talk about that.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="81bc" id="81bc" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 78.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*EwgRk1SlK92r0koqfbIpoQ.jpeg" data-width="1309" data-height="1023" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*EwgRk1SlK92r0koqfbIpoQ.jpeg"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Operation of an ancient shitpost machine, when shitposting was still a art (Daniel Niklaus Chodowiecki, 1774)</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="8f72" id="8f72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In days of olde, the only way that news could spread was by word of mouth, or by the use of printed newspapers or letters. The process was slow, cumbersome — and in the case of printing presses — also very expensive.</p><p name="bfa4" id="bfa4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Word of mouth had the bad habit of changing bits and parts of a story ever so slightly, ultimately resulting in a completely different story the further down it was passed on. There was also very little chance to actually providing a reliable source, unless you were the first to tell the story.</p><p name="298b" id="298b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The age of internet made all of that very easy, cheap and verifiable — and with the addition of blockchain it also became immutable and unchangeable.</p><p name="6730" id="6730" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many services and platforms came and went during the past 30 years that allowed people to talk to each other, discuss news or share their hobbies with one another across the globe. However, all of those services are centralized and also governed by a central entity that is capable of altering the content on their service or platform at will.</p><p name="9644" id="9644" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some platforms allow for discussion inside a certain frame while others embrace free speech without discrimination. Facebook for example enforces a very strong politically correct agenda, region blocking certain accounts or groups and going as far as to suspend offending accounts. Twitter is very similar, although not enforcing as strongly. This is okay, as the users of these platforms agreed to a certain set of terms and conditions to be able to use the service the platforms offer, but we need alternatives to those platforms.</p><p name="d70a" id="d70a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then we have platforms like 4chan, Reddit or Gab, all of them providing a different level of free speech and censorship. Gab — being the most “free” of the three — is under constant pressure by news outlets, calling for a shutdown of the “right wing platform” giving way to fascist ideologies and other despicable things. But make no mistake, Gab is no better than 4chan or Reddit in terms of being safe from censorship as the platform and it’s backend is controlled and maintained by a centralized entity.</p><p name="deff" id="deff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Availability of each single service is also a centralized nature; if the services no longer operate the webservers that the content and database is stored on, they become defunct and unavailable. The users are at the mercy of the operators to let them continue using the services.</p><p name="751a" id="751a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">0xchan will be the first truly decentralized platform to share ideas and discuss the things you love and hate with anybody in the world as there will be no domain needed to access the service; no single webserver will host the content, instead everything will be spread out via IPFS, always accessible and enabling users to clone the content and create new nodes, strenghtening the network through redundancy.</p><p name="66f1" id="66f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It has been quiet around the development during the past months, so what’s new?</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="3362" id="3362" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 1032px; max-height: 581px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*iPLYuOMoPxNz4P5poiCdKw.png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*iPLYuOMoPxNz4P5poiCdKw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Prototype of index page with recent post list visible, with the user not logged in</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="d98b" id="d98b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Since we didn’t hit our total target during the crowdfunding, we sadly need to attend to other jobs to secure some income while we develop. And while this does slow down our process for which we apologize, we came up with some changes that will create a shortcut to the final thing.</p><p name="a288" id="a288" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of deploying a website and then continuing the work to build a standalone app, we’re aiming to create the app first. Since this will be a cross-platform software, we’ll most likely rely on tools like Electron to create this. And since there are already good implementations of web3 inside an Electron application, we can build up on that knowledge to create a flawless experience for the users. Everything will be open sourced on a git repo so you can follow the development and involve yourself, should you wish to, by opening issues. A web-accessible version will be deployed afterwards as well.</p><p name="7a97" id="7a97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The big advantage of a standalone application on your desktop is simply this: there’s no need to dial into an URL to start using the service, instead the software hosts the HTML on your machine already and will only pull the content from the IPFS storage. This makes it impossible for any actor to restrict your access to the service.</p><p name="1f7a" id="1f7a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Currently, we are finalizing the core logic of the smart contracts, and bringing tons and tons of paper sketches into a digital prototyping stage. Once a proper UI and UX has been established, the prototypes will be turned into the product we’re all waiting for.</p><p name="7801" id="7801" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To finish this post, let me thank you for sticking around and for the ideas that you also throw around on Discord to improve the user experience and appeal of 0xchan.</p><p name="4df3" id="4df3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Thank you ❤</p></div></div></section><section name="1ca9" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="fa66" id="fa66" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing">I’ll be covering the development process of 0xchan through a series of Medium posts.
